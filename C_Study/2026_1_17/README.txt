I started learning about the C 10 mouths ago.
I was from China and started studying English just 6 years ago.
So I am not good at English,the grammar or the C language.
This is my first time to sent files to the Github.
You can find that I usually use the word "the".
And I am to lasy to write the comment.
I can write this in Chinese,but I wanna practice my Englisn.
Besides,I use the "raylib" to make this EXE.
I use VSCode instead of VS,Because of my computer,which is 3 years younger than me.
if you cannot use my file,use VSCode,download the raylib,and exchange the json.
